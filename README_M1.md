## General Info
The project was initialized to create an updated webpage for Horiseon that was accessible. The goal of creating an accessible website was also for increasing traffic to the website by improving SEO. The following improvements to the code were made:
* Semantic HTML elements replaced redundant elements.
* Repeated code removed and made more concise.
* The structure of the HTML elements reflects a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* The image elements in the HTML documents include alt attributes.
* Heading attributes are now in a sequential order.
* The title element is concise, yet descriptive.
